# Processing Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e1d72dc4-ad96-4b12-bc25-4ec2aa532ad7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/java-processing-faf822/deploys)

This repo holds the code for the [processing.org](https://processing.org) website. The website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the site!

## How To Contribute

By contributing to this repository you agree to follow our community guidelines. Before getting started, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/processing/processing-website/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). 

If this is your first time contributing on GitHub, check out this [guide for first contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

To contribute to the Processing website, you'll need to identify an issue, get assigned, fork this repo, set up the project on your local machine, make and test your changes, and then submit a pull request. 

### Step 1. Get assigned to an issue

Look at the [issues page](https://github.com/processing/processing-website/issues) for existing issues you can help with. Issues [labelled Good First Issue or Help Wanted](https://github.com/processing/processing-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22%2C%22Good+First+Issue%22+) are a good place to start. Or if you noticed an issue with the processing.org website and it hasn't been reported yet, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/processing/processing-website/issues/new/choose).

Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, leave a comment asking to be assigned. 

> [!NOTE]
> If this is your first contribution to our repositories, please include a brief explanation of how you plan to approach the issue. This helps us understand your thinking and gives us an opportunity to discuss the implementation. Note that **we do not auto-assign issues**, so comments that only say "please assign" without further context may be overlooked.

### Step 2. Fork the Repository

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner and follow the instructions to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project folder using the command line, or open the project in your editor of choice and open the built-in terminal.

### Step 3. Set up Your Local Environment

Make sure to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (`v12` or higher) if it is not already installed.

1. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Once the build process is complete, open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser to view the site.
4. Make your changes to the code.
5. Saving your files will automatically trigger a rebuild and update the local site.

### Step 4. Test Your Changes Locally

1. Make sure your changes are working locally and that they fixed the issue.
2. Make sure you only made the changes necessary to solve the issue. This will improve your chances of your PR getting merged.

### Step 5. Submit A Pull Request

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before submitting a pull request, please [ask to be assigned](#step-1-get-assigned-to-an-issue) to the corresponding issue. If someone else is already assigned or has shared that theyâ€™re working on it, we ask that you wait or choose another issue. This helps us avoid duplicated efforts and respect each other's time. PRs submitted without assignment may be closed without a review.

1. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
2. Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
3. Go to the original [Processing website repository](https://github.com/processing/processing-website) on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button.
4. Give your Pull Request a descriptive title.
5. Write a clear description of the changes you made and why they should be merged. Link to the issue you are solving.
6. Submit the pull request for review.

## Editing content

In order to edit the content on the website, it's important to understand how the translation and internationalization frameworks are set up. For this, we distinguish between two things:

### UI language

This content is more static, such as page headings and the descriptions on the front page. This is controlled by the `react-intl` package, and all definitions of UI language can be found in the [`i18n/react-intl`](/i18n/react-intl) folder. Each language will have its own `.json` file in this folder, and this is where edits to the UI language should happen.

### Page content

This content includes most of the content on the website such as the individual items under reference, tutorials, tools, etc. Each content type has its own setup based on where the source lives. As an example, the reference is generated from the Processing source code and has its own way of translating those generated files. The following guides explain how to change the content on the website by section.

- [Download](/docs/download.md)
- Documentation
  - [Reference](/docs/reference.md)
  - [Environment](/docs/markdown-pages.md)
  - [Libraries](/docs/libraries.md)
  - [Tools](/docs/tools.md)
- Learn
  - [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials.md)
  - [Examples](/docs/examples.md)
  - [Books](/docs/books.md)
- Teach (External link)
- [About](/docs/markdown-pages.md)
- Donate (External link)

When translating the content to a new language you need to edit the [`i18n/config.json`](/i18n/config.json) file and add your language information. Then follow the instructions for each Content list (same links as above).

## Writing code

- **CSS:** [read about our stylesheets](/docs/css.md)

## Deploying the site

Since 2024, this repository is deployed and built automatically on Netlify. Merged Pull Requests to main will trigger a deployment. No further action is necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> The following is included in the processing-website repository for historical reasons but it is not related to the functioning of the Processing website itself. It should eventually be moved to a more suitable location.

## `keywords.txt`

This repo contains a script [`updateKeywords.js`](https://github.com/processing/processing-website/blob/main/scripts/updateKeywords.js) that generates the [`keywords.txt`](https://github.com/processing/processing4/blob/6a2cf8cda35552c62a1a794bb1e20f43fe8ffcda/java/keywords.txt) file used for syntax highlighting in the Processing IDE. 

Follow these steps in order to generate the `keywords.txt` file:

1. Make sure you have this `processing-website` repo and the `processing4` repo next to each other on your computer
2. Make sure the [JavaDoc and reference](https://github.com/processing/processing-website/blob/main/docs/reference.md) are up to date with the latest version of Processing. Otherwise make the necessary updates to the JavaDoc in the `processing4` repo then [run the Doclet script](https://github.com/processing/processing-doclet/blob/main/README.md). _(note: this step is only necessary if new keywords were added to the Processing API)_
3. Run `npm run updateKeywords`

The `processing4` repo now has an updated `java/keywords.txt` file.

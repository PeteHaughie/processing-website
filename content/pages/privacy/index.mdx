## Processing Development Environment (PDE)
The Processing software itself does not collect any user data. The PDE (Processing Development Environment) runs entirely locally, and no data about your usage is tracked, stored, or shared with the Processing Foundation or any third parties. The PDE may connect to the Processing server to check for updates, but no personal information is collected in this process. If youâ€™d like, you can disable this update check in the settings.

## Processing Website
We are committed to respecting your privacy when you visit the Processing website. To understand website traffic and improve our services in the most privacy-friendly way possible, we use Fathom Analytics, a privacy-focused analytics platform.

Fathom Analytics does not use cookies and is fully compliant with privacy laws, including GDPR, ePrivacy (PECR), COPPA, and CCPA. Your IP address is briefly processed during your visit, but it is anonymized, and we have no means of identifying you. No personal information is stored or tracked over time.

The purpose of using Fathom Analytics is to understand website traffic and improve the user experience without compromising your privacy. Our legal basis for using this data, under GDPR, is Article 6(1)(f), where our legitimate interest is to continually improve the website. You can learn more about Fathom Analytics' privacy policy on their website at [https://usefathom.com/legal/privacy](https://usefathom.com/legal/privacy).

This policy is subject to change and will be updated on this page. We encourage users to review the policy regularly for any updates.

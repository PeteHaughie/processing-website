## Project Leads

[Ben Fry](https://benfry.com/) and [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/) started Processing in Spring 2001 and obsessively worked on it for over twenty years. In 2012, they established the Processing Foundation along with [Dan Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/), who formally joined as the third project lead. In August 2022, [Raphaël de Courville](https://twitter.com/sableraph) joined full-time as Processing Community Lead, under Casey Reas’ mentorship. In 2023, Ben, Casey, and Dan officially stepped down from their active roles as project leads, marking the beginning of a new era for Processing under the stewardship of the Processing Foundation.

## Libraries, Tools

The core Processing software is augmented by [libraries](https://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/), [modes](https://processing.org/environment/#adding-libraries-tools-and-modes), and [tools](https://processing.org/reference/tools/) contributed by the community. These contributions expand Processing's capabilities. For example, see how Jeongin Lee added machine learning via her [Creative Machine](https://jjeongin.github.io/creative-machine/) library.

## Website and Design

[Design Systems International](https://designsystems.international/) designed and built the current website and the new Processing family of logos through a year of dedicated volunteer work. A remarkable group of volunteers converted all of the content from the prior Processing website to the new formats. A hearty round of applause for:

Note from Casey: "I received a copy of this book from the authors on a recent trip to Japan. It's a beautifully produced full-color book with sections introducing Processing, featuring work created with Processing (many are from the Exhibition section of the Processing website), and introducing programming through progressively complicated examples. The majority of the book is an introduction to programming. There are many good examples and the code is color-coded like in the Processing Environment. This book is less comprehensive than the Greenberg and Reas/Fry books, but it appears to be a good, brief introduction."

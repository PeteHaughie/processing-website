An accessible, visual, and creative approach to learning core coding concepts using Processing's Python mode, Processing.py.

The publisher writes, "Right from the first chapter, you'll produce and manipulate colorful drawings, shapes and patterns as the author walks you through a series of easy-to-follow graphical coding projects that grow increasingly complex. You'll go from drawing with code to animating a bouncing DVD screensaver and practicing data-visualization techniques. Along the way, you'll encounter creative-yet-practical skill-building challenges that relate to everything from video games, cars, and coffee, to fine art, amoebas, and Pink Floyd. As you grow more fluent in both Python and programming in general, topics shift toward the mastery of algorithmic thinking, as you explore periodic motion, Lissajous curves, and using classes to create objects."
 
The publisher lists:

- Basic coding theories and concepts, like variables, data types, pixel coordinates, control flow and algorithms
- Writing code that produces drawings, patterns, animations, data visualizations, user interfaces, and simulations
- Using conditional statements, iteration, randomness, lists and dictionaries
- Defining functions, reducing repetition, and making your code more modular
- Writing classes and creating objects to structure code more efficiently

This book started as a set of tutorials for university level multimedia students to introduce them to computer programming through the development of artworks. It's therefore presented in a non-threatening way that will ease the reader into programming and has been written for absolute beginners who want to learn to program. It approaches coding through a unique combination of teaching programming while keeping in mind the principles of design and mathematics.

The chapters are organised to weave together programming functionality and design principles presenting one concept at a time, with multiple hands on exercises in each chapter.
